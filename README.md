# This assignment addresses the 3 step process in exploratory data analysis. Using a real estate data set, we want to find the variables that have
the potential to predict house price in the market. The notebook is segregated into three different parts:
  Part 1: Data understanding - analysis, exploration, visualization
  Part 2: Pre-Processing - missing values, encoding, outliers, ID, normalization, scaling
  Part 3: multicollinearity, feature selection
The autoviz function was utilized to initially analyze the dataset to provide a data quality report. However, it was excluded from the full run of
the notebook because of the glitches that occurred with Jupyter. 
All visualizations made in part 1 were to further analyze the variables and their relationships with price. Visualizations in part 3 were used to test
the multicollinearity after limiting to a few variables.
